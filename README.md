# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrea Falcon 

Senior Backend Developer with 9+ years of experience building web applications and APIs, mainly using PHP and Laravel.

I focus on designing scalable backend systems, developing MVPs, and turning ideas into working products. I also work on the frontend when needed using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

Currently interested in AI-assisted development, rapid prototyping, and product-oriented side projects.

Open to full remote opportunities or relocation outside of Italy.
