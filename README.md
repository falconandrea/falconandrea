# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Andrea Falcon

I am a backend developer with experience in building web applications using PHP, Laravel, and MySQL. While my primary focus is on the backend, I also have knowledge of frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Recently, I have been expanding my knowledge by learning Node.js, Solidity, and web3 tools.

I am passionate about the potential of blockchain and decentralized systems to transform the way we interact with the internet, and I am eager to explore the web3 space further. As a technology enthusiast, I am constantly seeking to learn and grow, and I am excited about the challenges that this constantly evolving field presents.

If you are involved in Web3 projects or share my passion for blockchain technology and decentralized systems, I would love to connect and explore potential collaborations. Let's work together to bring innovative solutions to the world of blockchain and decentralized applications. Feel free to reach out and connect with me! ðŸ˜„
