# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Andrea Falcon

I am a backend developer with experience in building web applications using PHP, Laravel, and MySQL. While my primary focus is on the backend, I also have knowledge of frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Recently, I have been expanding my knowledge by learning Node.js, Solidity, and web3 tools. 

I am passionate about the potential of blockchain and decentralized systems to transform the way we interact with the internet, and I am eager to explore the web3 space further. As a technology enthusiast, I am constantly seeking to learn and grow, and I am excited about the challenges that this constantly evolving field presents. 

I welcome the opportunity to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new ways to make an impact in the world of web3.
